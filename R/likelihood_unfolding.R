#' Get log likelihood of a particular unfolded graph
#'
#' This function unfolds a cyclic causal graph probabilitically for a set number of time steps
#' @param X The unfolding
#' @param graph the graph for which to compute the likelihood of this unfolding
#' @param pow How likely are the causal connections to cause their effects, defaults to .75
#' @param sar How likely are the components to turn on on their own, defaults to 0.
