#' Generates the outcome of an intervention or observation of a directed acyclic graph of binary variables
#'
#' This function computes the shannon entropy of a probability distribution.  It requires a second function called propagation.
#' @param int is the intervention expressed as a vector with 1 as on, -1 as off and zero as free.
#' graph is directed acyclic graph expressed as a directed adjacency matrix
#' br is the background activation rate, defaults to .1
#' pow is the causal power of the links, defaults to .9
#' @keywords action
#' @export
#' @examples
#' action(c(1,0,0), matrix(c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),3,3, byrow=T))
